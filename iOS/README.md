# Embrace Outdoors iOS Demo

This app is built in Swift and builds features to show off the [Embrace Apple SDK](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-apple-sdk).

It uses UITests to automate app activity for key mobile flows. Mobile developers should be able to use this to improve performance and observability generally in their applications.
